# Hello-World
I would like to share my experience with other Github subscribers
I'm having trouble trying to upgrade ConfigMgr from 1902 to 1906. I am on an Air-Gapped network and using the ServiceTool to download updates from the internet then I import the updatepacks to the air-gapped network using a USB. Long story short, importing updates is successful according to the dmpdownloader.log but Why I donâ€™t see SCCM Configmgr 196 updates in my console? I also check and I have acccess to All Security Scopes... Your help will be much appreciated
